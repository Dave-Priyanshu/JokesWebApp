# JokesWebApp
This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and involves configuring database tables using the Entity Framework. It establishes classes as models, customizes Razor forms, and implements methods within controllers. Styling of ASP.NET pages is achieved using CSS, including Bootstrap classes for enhanced visual design. Additionally, a search functionality is created to filter database results efficiently.
